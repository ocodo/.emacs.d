;;; Commentary:

;; A simple history keeping for dired buffers.  All the visited
;; directories get saved for reuse later.  Works great with Ivy and
;; other `completing-read' replacements.

;;  HOW TO USE IT:
;;
;;   (require 'dired-recent)
;;   (dired-recent-mode 1)
;;
;;  C-x C-d (`dired-recent-open')

;;; Code:
