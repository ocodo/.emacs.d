;; `beginning-of-defun' and `end-of-defun'
;;
;; A defun is a declaration except local variable, "get", "set", "willSet",
;; "didSet", or "case" within enum.
;;
;; A defun include modifiers, attributes, and comments on the same line.
;;
;; `swift-mode:beginning-of-defun' moves the point to the beginning of a defun
;; that precedes (if the arg is positive) or follows (if the arg is negative)
;; the original point and has the same or less nesting level.
;;
;; `swift-mode:end-of-defun' moves the point to the end of a defun
;; that follows (if the arg is positive) or precedes (if the arg is negative)
;; the original point and has the same or less nesting level.
