;;; Commentary:

;; This allows you to track where you've last left off a buffer.

;; Use (enable-lui-track) to enable this mode globally. You can
;; customize `lui-track-behavior' to change when the track indicator
;; moves and `lui-track-indicator' to choose between a bar or a fringe
;; indicator. You can also use M-x lui-track-move to move the track
;; indicator manually, and M-x lui-track-jump-to-indicator to move to
;; the line marked by the indicator.
