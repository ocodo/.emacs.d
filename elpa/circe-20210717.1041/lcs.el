;;; Commentary:

;; lcs.el is a library for other Emacs Lisp programs not useful by
;; itself.

;; This library provides functions to find the Longest Common Sequence
;; (LCS) of two sequences. This is used to create a unified diff of to
;; two lists. See `lcs-unified-diff' for a useful function to be
;; called.

;; The code is more or less a literal translation of (part of)
;; Gauche's util/lcs.scm module to Emacs Lisp.
