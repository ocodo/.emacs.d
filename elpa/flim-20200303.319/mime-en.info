3 Message and Entity
********************

According to RFC 2045 (*note RFC 2045::), 'The term "entity", refers
specifically to the MIME-defined header fields and contents of either a
message or one of the parts in the body of a multipart entity.'  In this
document, the term *entity* indicates all of header fields and body.

   The definition of RFC 2045 indicates that a MIME message is a tree,
and each node of the tree is an entity.  Namely MIME extends message to
tree structure.

   FLIM uses *mime-entity* structure to represent information of entity.
In this document, it is called simply 'mime-entity'.

3.1 Functions to create mime-entity
===================================

 -- Function: mime-open-entity &optional type location

     Open an entity and return it.

     TYPE is representation-type.  (cf.  *note mm-backend::)

     LOCATION is location of entity.  Specification of it is depended on
     representation-type.

 -- Function: mime-parse-buffer &optional buffer type

     Parse BUFFER as message, and set the result to buffer local
     variable 'mime-message-structure' of BUFFER as mime-entity.

     If BUFFER is omitted, current buffer is used.

     TYPE is representation-type of created mime-entity.  (cf.  *note
     mm-backend::) Default value is BUFFER.

3.2 Features about message tree
===============================

Structure of a MIME message is tree.

   In the tree, root node is the entity indicates all of the message.
In this document, it is called *root-entity* or *message*.  In FLIM, it
is indicated by buffer local variable 'mime-message-structure'.

   Each entity except root-entity has a parent.  An entity may have
children.  We can indicate an entity by relative position from a base
entity, based on the parent-child relationship.

   In addition, we can indicate an entity by absolute position of the
message.

   Each entity, which is a node of the tree, can be numbered by depth
and left-to-right order of the depth.

                                   +-------+
                                   |  nil  |
                                   +---+---+
                   +-------------------+-------------------+
                 +-+-+               +-+-+               +-+-+
                 | 0 |               | 1 |               | 2 |
                 +-+-+               +-+-+               +-+-+
                   |         +---------+---------+         |
                +--+--+   +--+--+   +--+--+   +--+--+   +--+--+
                | 0.0 |   | 1.0 |   | 1.1 |   | 1.2 |   | 2.0 |
                +-----+   +-----+   +-----+   +-----+   +-----+

   Namely, if depth of a node is n, the node has a node-number, which is
consists of n integers.  In this document, it is called *entity-number*.
An entity-number is represented by list of integer, like '(1 2 3)'.

   mime-entity has also *node-id*.  A node-id is represented by reversed
list of entity-number.  For example, node-id corresponding with 1.2.3 is
'(3 2 1)'.

   Each entity can be indicated by entity-number or node-id in
'mime-message-structure'.

3.10 Entity representations and implementations
===============================================

Entity is an abstraction.  It is designed to use various data
representations for their purposes.

   Each entity has *representation-type*.  It must be specified when an
entity is created.  (cf.  *note Entity creation::)

   Functions about entity are implemented by request processing to the
entity.  Each entity knows its representation-type.  Each entity calls
processing function corresponding with the representation-type.  Such
kind of function is called *entity processing method*.  A module,
consists of them corresponding with a representation-type, is called
*mm-backend*.

   Module name of each mm-backend consists of the prefix 'mm' and its
representation-type.  The module is required automatically when its
entity is created at first.

3.10.2 Definition of mm-backend
-------------------------------

 -- Macro: mm-define-backend type &optional parents

     Define TYPE as a mm-backend.

     If PARENTS is specified, TYPE inherits parents.  Each parent must
     be representation-type.

     Example:

          (mm-define-backend chao (generic))

 -- Macro: mm-define-method name args &rest body

     Define NAME as a method function of (nth 1 (car ARGS)) backend.

     ARGS is like an argument list of lambda, but (car ARGS) must be
     specialized parameter.  (car (car ARGS)) is name of variable and
     (nth 1 (car ARGS)) is name of backend (representation-type).

     Example:

          (mm-define-method entity-cooked-p ((entity chao)) nil)

4 Information of Content-Type field
***********************************

*Content-Type field* is a field to indicate kind of contents or data
format, such as media-type (*note media-type::) and MIME charset.  It is
defined in RFC 2045 (*note RFC 2045::).

*[Memo]*

     Historically, Content-Type field was proposed in RFC 1049.  In it,
     Content-Type did not distinguish type and subtype, and there are no
     mechanism to represent kind of character code like MIME charset.

   FLIM provides parser for Content-Type field and structure
*mime-content-type* to store information of Content-Type field.

* Menu:

* Content-Type field::          Format of Content-Type field
* mime-content-type::           mime-content-type structure
* Content-Type parser::         Parser
* Content-Type utility::        Utility functions


File: mime-en.info,  Node: Content-Type field,  Next: mime-content-type,  Prev: Content-Type,  Up: Content-Type

4.1 Format of Content-Type field
================================

Format of Content-Type field is defined as follows:

     "Content-Type" ":" *type* "/" *subtype* *( ";" *parameter* )

   For example:

          Content-Type: image/jpeg

          Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-jp

   'type' and 'subtype' indicate format of an entity.  In this document,
pair of them is called 'media-type'.  'image/jpeg' or 'text/plain' is a
media-type.

*[Memo]*

     If an entity does not have Content-Type field, it is regarded as
     following:

               Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

     (cf.  *note us-ascii::)

6.4 How to write encoder/decoder module
=======================================

 -- Macro: mel-define-method name args &rest body

     Define NAME as a method function of (nth 1 (car (last ARGS)))
     backend.

     ARGS is like an argument list of lambda, but (car (last ARGS)) must
     be specialized parameter.  (car (car (last ARGS))) is name of
     variable and (nth 1 (car (last ARGS))) is name of backend
     (encoding).

     Example:

          (mel-define-method mime-write-decoded-region (start end filename
          						    (nil "base64"))
            "Decode and write current region encoded by base64 into FILENAME.
          START and END are buffer positions."
            (interactive
             (list (region-beginning) (region-end)
          	 (read-file-name "Write decoded region to file: ")))
            (let ((str (buffer-substring start end)))
              (with-temp-buffer
                (insert (decode-base64-string str))
                (write-region-as-binary (point-min) (point-max) filename)
                )))

 -- Macro: mel-define-method-function spec function

     Set SPEC's function definition to FUNCTION.

     First element of SPEC is service.

     Rest of ARGS is like an argument list of lambda, but (car (last
     ARGS)) must be specialized parameter.  (car (car (last ARGS))) is
     name of variable and (nth 1 (car (last ARGS))) is name of backend
     (encoding).

     Example:

6.5 How to add encoding/decoding service
========================================

 -- Macro: mel-define-service name &optional args doc-string

     Define NAME as a service for Content-Transfer-Encodings.

     If ARGS is specified, NAME is defined as a generic function for the
     service.

     Example:

          (mel-define-service encoded-text-encode-string (string encoding)
            "Encode STRING as encoded-text using ENCODING.
          ENCODING must be string.")

7 Network representation of header
**********************************

*RFC 2047* defines the *encoded-word* which is a format to represent
non-ASCII (*note ASCII::) characters in a header.

[RFC 2047]
     K. Moore, "MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Three:
     Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text", November 1996,
     Standards Track (obsolete RFC 1521,1522,1590).

   The encoded-word is the only valid format to represent non-ASCII
(*note ASCII::) characters in a header, but there are also invalid
styles.  Such kinds of evil messages represent non-ASCII (*note ASCII::)
characters in headers without encoded-words (it is called "raw"
non-ASCII (*note ASCII::) characters).

   FLIM provides encoding/decoding features of both encoded-word and
invalid "raw" non-ASCII (*note ASCII::) characters.

7.1 Header encoding/decoding
============================

 -- Function: eword-decode-header &optional code-conversion separator

     Decode MIME encoded-words in header fields.

     If CODE-CONVERSION is 'nil', only encoded-words are decoded.  If
     CODE-CONVERSION is a MIME charset (*note MIME charset::), non-ASCII
     bit patterns are decoded as the MIME charset.  Otherwise non-ASCII
     bit patterns are decoded as the 'default-mime-charset'.  (cf.
     *note entity formatting::)

     If SEPARATOR is not 'nil', it is used as header separator.

 -- Function: eword-encode-header &optional code-conversion

     Encode header fields to network representation, such as MIME
     encoded-word.

     Each field is encoded as corresponding method specified by variable
     'mime-field-encoding-method-alist'.

 -- Variable: mime-field-encoding-method-alist

     Association list to specify field encoding method.  Each element
     looks like (FIELD .  METHOD).

     If METHOD is 'mime', the FIELD will be encoded into MIME format
     (encoded-word).

     If METHOD is 'nil', the FIELD will not be encoded.

     If METHOD is a MIME charset, the FIELD will be encoded as the
     charset when it must be convert into network-code.

     Otherwise the FIELD will be encoded as variable
     'default-mime-charset' when it must be convert into network-code.

9.1.1 7bit
----------

*7bit* means any integer between 0 ..  127.

   Any data represented by 7bit integers is called *7bit data*.

   Textual string consisted of Control characters between 0 ..  31 and
127, and space represented by 32, and graphic characters between 33 ..
236 are called *7bit (textual) string*.

   Conventional Internet MTA (*note MTA::) can translate 7bit data, so
it is no need to translate by Quoted-Printable (*note
Quoted-Printable::) or Base64 (*note Base64::) for 7bit data.

   However if there are too long lines, it can not translate by 7bit MTA
even if it is 7bit data.  RFC 822 (*note RFC 822::) and RFC 2045 (*note
RFC 2045::) require lines in 7bit data must be less than 998 bytes.  So
if a "7bit data" has a line more than 999 bytes, it is regarded as
binary (*note binary::).  For example, Postscript file should be encoded
by Quoted-Printable.

9.1.2 8bit
----------

*8bit* means any integer between 0 ..  255.

   Any data represented by 8bit integers is called *8bit data*.

   Textual string consisted of Control characters between 0 ..  31, 127,
and 128 ..  159, and space represented by 32, and graphic characters
between 33 ..  236 and 160 ..  255 are called *8bit (textual) string*.

   For example, iso-8859-1 or euc-kr are coded-character-set represented
by 8bit textual string.

   Traditional Internet MTA (*note MTA::) can translate only 7bit (*note
7bit::) data, so if a 8bit data will be translated such MTA, it must be
encoded by Quoted-Printable (*note Quoted-Printable::) or Base64 (*note
Base64::).

   However 8bit MTA are increasing today.

   However if there are too long lines, it can not translate by 8bit MTA
even if it is 8bit data.  RFC 2045 (*note RFC 2045::) require lines in
8bit data must be less than 998 bytes.  So if a "8bit data" has a line
more than 999 bytes, it is regarded as binary (*note binary::), so it
must be encoded by Base64 or Quoted-Printable.

9.1.3 ASCII
-----------

*ASCII* is a 94-character set contains primary latin characters (A-Z,
a-z), numbers and some characters.  It is a standard of the United
States of America.  It is a variant of ISO 646.

[ASCII]

9.1.4 Base64
------------

*Base64* is a transfer encoding method of MIME (*note MIME::) defined in
RFC 2045 (*note RFC 2045::).

   The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits as output
strings of 4 encoded characters.  Encoded characters represent integer 0
..  63 or *pad*.  Base64 data must be 4 * n bytes, so pad is used to
adjust size.

   These 65 characters are subset of all versions of ISO 646, including
US-ASCII, and all versions of EBCDIC. So it is safe even if it is
translated by non-Internet gateways.

9.1.5 binary
------------

Any byte stream is called *binary*.

   It does not require structureof lines.  It differs from from 8bit
(*note 8bit::).

   In addition, if line structured data contain too long line (more than
998 bytes), it is regarded as binary.

9.1.7 media-type
----------------

*media-type* specifies the nature of the data in the body of MIME (*note
MIME::) entity (*note Entity::).  It consists of *type* and *subtype*.
It is defined in RFC 2046 (*note RFC 2046::).

   Currently there are following standard primary-types:

   * *text*
   * *image*
   * *audio*
   * *video*
   * *application*
   * *multipart*
   * *message*

   And there are various subtypes, for example,
application/octet-stream, audio/basic, image/jpeg, multipart/mixed,
text/plain, video/mpeg...

   You can refer registered media types at MEDIA TYPES
(ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types).

   In addition, you can use private type or subtype using *x-token*,
which as the prefix 'x-'.  However you can not use them in public.

9.1.9 MIME
----------

MIME stands for *Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions*, it is an
extension for RFC 822 (*note RFC 822::).

   According to RFC 2045:

   STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying
considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the
message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This set of
documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for

  1. textual message bodies in character sets other than US-ASCII,
  2. an extensible set of different formats for non-textual message
     bodies,
  3. multi-part message bodies, and
  4. textual header information in character sets other than US-ASCII.

   It is defined in RFC 2045 (*note RFC 2045::), RFC 2046 (*note RFC
2046::), RFC 2047 (*note encoded-word::), RFC 2048 (*note RFC 2048::)

   It is defined in RFC 2045 (*note RFC 2045::).

   iso-2022-jp or euc-kr are kinds of it.  (In this document, MIME
charsets are written by small letters to distinguish graphic character
set.  For example, ISO 8859-1 is a graphic character set, and iso-8859-1
is a MIME charset)

9.2 How to report bugs
======================

If you write bug-reports and/or suggestions for improvement, please send
them to the EMACS-MIME Mailing List:

   * English <emacs-mime-en@m17n.org>
   * Japanese <emacs-mime-ja@m17n.org>

   Notice that, we do not welcome bug reports about too old version.
Bugs in old version might be fixed.  So please try latest version at
first.

   You should write *good bug report*.  If you write only "FLIM does not
work", we can not find such situations.  At least, you should write
name, type, variants and version of OS, emacs, APEL, FLIM, SEMI and MUA,
and setting.  In addition, if error occurs, to send backtrace is very
important.  (cf.  *note (emacs)Bugs::)

   Bug may not appear only your environment, but also in a lot of
environment (otherwise it might not bug).  Therefor if you send mail to
author directly, we must write a lot of mails.  So please send mail to
address for EMACS-MIME Mailing List instead of author.

   Via the EMACS-MIME ML, you can report FLIM bugs, obtain the latest
release of FLIM, and discuss future enhancements to FLIM. To join the
EMACS-MIME ML, send an empty e-mail to:

   * English <emacs-mime-en-ctl@m17n.org>
   * Japanese <emacs-mime-ja-ctl@m17n.org>

9.4 History of FLIM
===================

FLIM の code の最古の部分は 榎並 嗣智 氏が書いた 'mime.el' に起源し ます
。この小さな program は Nemacs で動作する iso-2022-jp の B-encoding 専用
の encoded-word の復号化プログラムでした。

   その後、守岡 知彦 は 'mime.el' を元に'tiny-mime.el' というプロ グラム
を書きます。これは、Nemacs と Mule で動作する encoded-word の符号 化・復
号化プログラムでした。'tiny-mime.el' は B-encoding だけでなく Q-encoding
もsupport し、また、MULE で扱うことができるさまざまな MIME charset
(*note MIME charset::) を同時に使うことができました。この時、 Nemacs と
Mule の双方を support するために用いられたテクニックは後に emu package に
まとめられます。

   この頃、守岡 知彦 は 'tiny-mime.el' をさまざまな MUA で使うための設 定
集も配布していましたが、それらは後に'tiny-mime.el' とともに１つの
package にまとめられ、tm という名前で配布されます。

   守岡 知彦 はやがて、MIME message を閲覧するためのプログラムである
'tm-body.el' を書きます。これは、すぐに'tm-view.el' という名前 に変わり
ましたが、やがて、これが'tiny-mime.el' に代わって、tm の中 核となります
。

   'tm-view.el' は当然、Content-Transfer-Encoding を扱う必要があります。
この目的のために、MEL が整備されはじめました。Base64 に関しては
'tiny-mime.el' の code が移され、また、新たにQuoted-Printable の code が
追加されました。これらが'mel-b.el' と 'mel-q.el' になり ました。

   また、後に、守岡 知彦 によって uuencode 用の 'mel-u.el' が追加され、
その後に、小林 修平 氏によって x-gzip64 用の'mel-g.el' が追加されま した
。

   tm では後に、守岡 知彦 によって 'tiny-mime.el' の再実装が行われ、こ の
過程で、STD 11 の parser が書かれました。これは、現在の 'std11.el' に当
たります。また、この過程で 'tiny-mime.el' は復 号化を行う 'tm-ew-d.el' と
符号化を行う 'tm-ew-e.el' に分けられ ました。この両者が現在の
'eword-decode.el' と 'eword-encode.el' の先祖に当たります。

   後に、守岡 知彦 らによって tm の全面書き換え作業が行われ、この過程で
、tm は APEL, MEL, SEMI, EMH, RMAIL-MIME, Gnus-MIME などに分けられました
。こ のうちの MEL が FLIM の直接の先祖に当たります。

   後に、APEL から 'std11.el' が移され、また、'mailcap.el',
'eword-decode.el' および 'eword-encode.el' が SEMI から移され、 package
の名前が FLIM となります。

   この直前から田中 哲 氏がより RFC に忠実な実装を書き始め、これは、現在
、 FLIM の枝である "FLIM-FLAM" となっています。
