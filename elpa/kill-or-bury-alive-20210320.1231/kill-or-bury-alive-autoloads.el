Kill buffers selected by the BUFFER-DESIGNATOR with KILLING-FUNCTION.

See the description of `kill-or-bury-alive--buffer-match' for
information about the concept of buffer designators.

Normally, KILLING-FUNCTION should be able to take one argument:
buffer object.  However, you can use a function that operates on
the current buffer and doesn't take any arguments.  Just pass
non-NIL SIMPLE argument and KILLING-FUNCTION will be wrapped as
needed automatically.

Kill or bury the current buffer.

This is a universal killing mechanism.  When argument ARG is
given and it's not NIL, kill the current buffer.  Otherwise the
behavior of this command varies.  If the current buffer matches a
buffer designator listed in `kill-or-bury-alive-must-die-list',
kill it immediately, otherwise just bury it.

You can specify how to kill various kinds of buffers, see
`kill-or-bury-alive-killing-function-alist' for more information.
Buffers are killed with `kill-or-bury-alive-killing-function' by
default.

Kill all buffers except for the long lasting ones.

The long lasting buffers are specified in
`kill-or-bury-alive-long-lasting-list'.

If `kill-or-bury-alive-base-buffer' is not NIL, switch to the
buffer with that name after purging and delete all other windows.

When ARG is given and it's not NIL, ask to confirm killing of
every buffer.
