;;
;; Known bugs:
;;
;; * Multiline strings using """ and ''' are not recognized. They fontify
;;   correctly, but only because they look like three strings in a row.
;; * In a map with identifier keys, the first key is fontified like a label.
;; * Return values for operator methods aren't fontified correctly.
;; * Untyped parameters aren't fontified correctly.
;; * Quotes immediately after string interpolation are marked as unclosed.
;; * Sexp movement doesn't properly ignore quotes in interpolation.
;; * Methods using "=>" can cause indentation woes.
;; * C and C++ modes seem to be hosed.
