10.4.1 Theming Faces
--------------------

The default theme uses blue for local branches, green for remote
branches, and goldenrod (brownish yellow) for tags.  When creating a new
theme, you should probably follow that example.  If your theme already
uses other colors, then stick to that.

   In older releases these reference faces used to have a background
color and a box around them.  The basic default faces no longer do so,
to make Magit buffers much less noisy, and you should follow that
example at least with regards to boxes.  (Boxes were used in the past to
work around a conflict between the highlighting overlay and text
property backgrounds.  That’s no longer necessary because highlighting
no longer causes other background colors to disappear.)  Alternatively
you can keep the background color and/or box, but then have to take
special care to adjust ‘magit-branch-current’ accordingly.  By default
it looks mostly like ‘magit-branch-local’, but with a box (by default
the former is the only face that uses a box, exactly so that it sticks
out).  If the former also uses a box, then you have to make sure that it
differs in some other way from the latter.

   The most difficult faces to theme are those related to diffs,
headings, highlighting, and the region.  There are faces that fall into
all four groups - expect to spend some time getting this right.

   The ‘region’ face in the default theme, in both the light and dark
variants, as well as in many other themes, distributed with Emacs or by
third-parties, is very ugly.  It is common to use a background color
that really sticks out, which is ugly but if that were the only problem
then it would be acceptable.  Unfortunately many themes also set the
foreground color, which ensures that all text within the region is
readable.  Without doing that there might be cases where some foreground
color is too close to the region background color to still be readable.
But it also means that text within the region loses all syntax
highlighting.

   I consider the work that went into getting the ‘region’ face right to
be a good indicator for the general quality of a theme.  My
recommendation for the ‘region’ face is this: use a background color
slightly different from the background color of the ‘default’ face, and
do not set the foreground color at all.  So for a light theme you might
use a light (possibly tinted) gray as the background color of ‘default’
and a somewhat darker gray for the background of ‘region’.  That should
usually be enough to not collide with the foreground color of any other
face.  But if some other faces also set a light gray as background
color, then you should also make sure it doesn’t collide with those (in
some cases it might be acceptable though).

   Magit only uses the ‘region’ face when the region is "invalid" by its
own definition.  In a Magit buffer the region is used to either select
multiple sibling sections, so that commands which support it act on all
of these sections instead of just the current section, or to select
lines within a single hunk section.  In all other cases, the section is
considered invalid and Magit won’t act on it.  But such invalid sections
happen, either because the user has not moved point enough yet to make
it valid or because she wants to use a non-magit command to act on the
region, e.g.  ‘kill-region’.

   So using the regular ‘region’ face for invalid sections is a feature.
It tells the user that Magit won’t be able to act on it.  It’s
acceptable if that face looks a bit odd and even (but less so) if it
collides with the background colors of section headings and other things
that have a background color.

   Magit highlights the current section.  If a section has subsections,
then all of them are highlighted.  This is done using faces that have
"highlight" in their names.  For most sections,
‘magit-section-highlight’ is used for both the body and the heading.
Like the ‘region’ face, it should only set the background color to
something similar to that of ‘default’.  The highlight background color
must be different from both the ‘region’ background color and the
‘default’ background color.

   For diff related sections Magit uses various faces to highlight
different parts of the selected section(s).  Note that hunk headings,
unlike all other section headings, by default have a background color,
because it is useful to have very visible separators between hunks.
That face ‘magit-diff-hunk-heading’, should be different from both
‘magit-diff-hunk-heading-highlight’ and ‘magit-section-highlight’, as
well as from ‘magit-diff-context’ and ‘magit-diff-context-highlight’.
By default we do that by changing the foreground color.  Changing the
background color would lead to complications, and there are already
enough we cannot get around.  (Also note that it is generally a good
idea for section headings to always be bold, but only for sections that
have subsections).

   When there is a valid region selecting diff-related sibling sections,
i.e.  multiple files or hunks, then the bodies of all these sections use
the respective highlight faces, but additionally the headings instead
use one of the faces ‘magit-diff-file-heading-selection’ or
‘magit-diff-hunk-heading-selection’.  These faces have to be different
from the regular highlight variants to provide explicit visual
indication that the region is active.

   When theming diff related faces, start by setting the option
‘magit-diff-refine-hunk’ to ‘all’.  You might personally prefer to only
refine the current hunk or not use hunk refinement at all, but some of
the users of your theme want all hunks to be refined, so you have to
cater to that.

   (Also turn on ‘magit-diff-highlight-indentation’,
‘magit-diff-highlight-trailing’, and ‘magit-diff-paint-whitespace’; and
insert some whitespace errors into the code you use for testing.)

   For e.g.  "added lines" you have to adjust three faces:
‘magit-diff-added’, ‘magit-diff-added-highlight’, and
‘smerge-refined-added’.  Make sure that the latter works well with both
of the former, as well as ‘smerge-other’ and ‘diff-added’.  Then do the
same for the removed lines, context lines, lines added by us, and lines
added by them.  Also make sure the respective added, removed, and
context faces use approximately the same saturation for both the
highlighted and unhighlighted variants.  Also make sure the file and
diff headings work nicely with context lines (e.g.  make them look
different).  Line faces should set both the foreground and the
background color.  For example, for added lines use two different
greens.

   It’s best if the foreground color of both the highlighted and the
unhighlighted variants are the same, so you will need to have to find a
color that works well on the highlight and unhighlighted background, the
refine background, and the highlight context background.  When there is
an hunk internal region, then the added- and removed-lines background
color is used only within that region.  Outside the region the
highlighted context background color is used.  This makes it easier to
see what is being staged.  With an hunk internal region the hunk heading
is shown using ‘magit-diff-hunk-heading-selection’, and so are the thin
lines that are added around the lines that fall within the region.  The
background color of that has to be distinct enough from the various
other involved background colors.

   Nobody said this would be easy.  If your theme restricts itself to a
certain set of colors, then you should make an exception here.
Otherwise it would be impossible to make the diffs look good in each and
every variation.  Actually you might want to just stick to the default
definitions for these faces.  You have been warned.  Also please note
that if you do not get this right, this will in some cases look to users
like bugs in Magit - so please do it right or not at all.

File: magit.info,  Node: How to show git's output?,  Next: How to install the gitman info manual?,  Up: FAQ - How to …?

A.1.1 How to show git’s output?
-------------------------------

To show the output of recently run git commands, press ‘$’ (or, if that
isn’t available, ‘M-x magit-process-buffer’).  This will show a buffer
containing a section per git invocation; as always press ‘TAB’ to expand
or collapse them.

   By default, git’s output is only inserted into the process buffer if
it is run for side-effects.  When the output is consumed in some way,
also inserting it into the process buffer would be too expensive.  For
debugging purposes, it’s possible to do so anyway by setting
‘magit-git-debug’ to ‘t’.


File: magit.info,  Node: How to install the gitman info manual?,  Next: How to show diffs for gpg-encrypted files?,  Prev: How to show git's output?,  Up: FAQ - How to …?

A.1.2 How to install the gitman info manual?
--------------------------------------------

Git’s manpages can be exported as an info manual called ‘gitman’.
Magit’s own info manual links to nodes in that manual instead of the
actual manpages because Info doesn’t support linking to manpages.

   Unfortunately some distributions do not install the ‘gitman’ manual
by default and you will have to install a separate documentation package
to get it.

   Magit patches Info adding the ability to visit links to the ‘gitman’
Info manual by instead viewing the respective manpage.  If you prefer
that approach, then set the value of ‘magit-view-git-manual-method’ to
one of the supported packages ‘man’ or ‘woman’, e.g.:

     (setq magit-view-git-manual-method 'man)


File: magit.info,  Node: How to show diffs for gpg-encrypted files?,  Next: How does branching and pushing work?,  Prev: How to install the gitman info manual?,  Up: FAQ - How to …?

A.1.3 How to show diffs for gpg-encrypted files?
------------------------------------------------

Git supports showing diffs for encrypted files, but has to be told to do
so.  Since Magit just uses Git to get the diffs, configuring Git also
affects the diffs displayed inside Magit.

     git config --global diff.gpg.textconv "gpg --no-tty --decrypt"
     echo "*.gpg filter=gpg diff=gpg" > .gitattributes


File: magit.info,  Node: How does branching and pushing work?,  Next: Can Magit be used as ‘ediff-version-control-package’?,  Prev: How to show diffs for gpg-encrypted files?,  Up: FAQ - How to …?

A.1.4 How does branching and pushing work?
------------------------------------------

Please see *note Branching:: and
<http://emacsair.me/2016/01/18/magit-2.4>


File: magit.info,  Node: Can Magit be used as ‘ediff-version-control-package’?,  Prev: How does branching and pushing work?,  Up: FAQ - How to …?

A.1.5 Can Magit be used as ‘ediff-version-control-package’?
-----------------------------------------------------------

No, it cannot.  For that to work the functions ‘ediff-magit-internal’
and ‘ediff-magit-merge-internal’ would have to be implemented, and they
are not.  These two functions are only used by the three commands
‘ediff-revision’, ‘ediff-merge-revisions-with-ancestor’, and
‘ediff-merge-revisions’.

   These commands only delegate the task of populating buffers with
certain revisions to the "internal" functions.  The equally important
task of determining which revisions are to be compared/merged is not
delegated.  Instead this is done without any support whatsoever from the
version control package/system - meaning that the user has to enter the
revisions explicitly.  Instead of implementing ‘ediff-magit-internal’ we
provide ‘magit-ediff-compare’, which handles both tasks like it is 2005.

   The other commands ‘ediff-merge-revisions’ and
‘ediff-merge-revisions-with-ancestor’ are normally not what you want
when using a modern version control system like Git.  Instead of letting
the user resolve only those conflicts which Git could not resolve on its
own, they throw away all work done by Git and then expect the user to
manually merge all conflicts, including those that had already been
resolved.  That made sense back in the days when version control systems
couldn’t merge (or so I have been told), but not anymore.  Once in a
blue moon you might actually want to see all conflicts, in which case
you *can* use these commands, which then use ‘ediff-vc-merge-internal’.
So we don’t actually have to implement ‘ediff-magit-merge-internal’.
Instead we provide the more useful command ‘magit-ediff-resolve’ which
only shows yet-to-be resolved conflicts.

File: magit.info,  Node: Magit is slow,  Next: I changed several thousand files at once and now Magit is unusable,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.1 Magit is slow
-------------------

See *note Performance::.


File: magit.info,  Node: I changed several thousand files at once and now Magit is unusable,  Next: I am having problems committing,  Prev: Magit is slow,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.2 I changed several thousand files at once and now Magit is unusable
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magit is *currently* not expected to work under such conditions.  It
sure would be nice if it did, and v2.5 will hopefully be a big step into
that direction.  But it might take until v3.1 to accomplish fully
satisfactory performance, because that requires some heavy refactoring.

   But for now we recommend you use the command line to complete this
one commit.  Also see *note Performance::.


File: magit.info,  Node: I am having problems committing,  Next: I am using MS Windows and cannot push with Magit,  Prev: I changed several thousand files at once and now Magit is unusable,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.3 I am having problems committing
-------------------------------------

That likely means that Magit is having problems finding an appropriate
emacsclient executable.  See *note (with-editor)Configuring
With-Editor:: and *note (with-editor)Debugging::.


File: magit.info,  Node: I am using MS Windows and cannot push with Magit,  Next: I am using OS X and SOMETHING works in shell but not in Magit,  Prev: I am having problems committing,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.4 I am using MS Windows and cannot push with Magit
------------------------------------------------------

It’s almost certain that Magit is only incidental to this issue.  It is
much more likely that this is a configuration issue, even if you can
push on the command line.

   Detailed setup instructions can be found at
<https://github.com/magit/magit/wiki/Pushing-with-Magit-from-Windows>.


File: magit.info,  Node: I am using OS X and SOMETHING works in shell but not in Magit,  Next: Diffs contain control sequences,  Prev: I am using MS Windows and cannot push with Magit,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.5 I am using OS X and SOMETHING works in shell, but not in Magit
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This usually occurs because Emacs doesn’t have the same environment
variables as your shell.  Try installing and configuring
<https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell>.  By default it
synchronizes ‘$PATH’, which helps Magit find the same ‘git’ as the one
you are using on the shell.

   If SOMETHING is "passphrase caching with gpg-agent for commit and/or
tag signing", then you’ll also need to synchronize ‘$GPG_AGENT_INFO’.


File: magit.info,  Node: Diffs contain control sequences,  Next: Expanding a file to show the diff causes it to disappear,  Prev: I am using OS X and SOMETHING works in shell but not in Magit,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.6 Diffs contain control sequences
-------------------------------------

This happens when you configure Git to always color diffs and/or all of
its output.  The valid values for relevant Git variables ‘color.ui’ and
‘color.diff’ are ‘false’, ‘true’ and ‘always’, and the default is
‘true’.  You should leave it that because then you get colorful output
in terminals but git’s output is consumed by something else, then no
colors are used.

   If you actually use some other tool which expects that requires that
you force git to output control sequences (which is highly unlikely),
then you can override these settings just for Magit by using:

     (setq magit-git-global-arguments
           (nconc magit-git-global-arguments
                  '("-c" "color.ui=false"
                    "-c" "color.diff=false")))


File: magit.info,  Node: Expanding a file to show the diff causes it to disappear,  Next: Point is wrong in the ‘COMMIT_EDITMSG’ buffer,  Prev: Diffs contain control sequences,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.7 Expanding a file to show the diff causes it to disappear
--------------------------------------------------------------

This is probably caused by a change of a ‘diff.*’ Git variable.  You
probably set that variable for a reason, and should therefore only undo
that setting in Magit by customizing ‘magit-git-global-arguments’.


File: magit.info,  Node: Point is wrong in the ‘COMMIT_EDITMSG’ buffer,  Next: The mode-line information isn't always up-to-date,  Prev: Expanding a file to show the diff causes it to disappear,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.8 Point is wrong in the ‘COMMIT_EDITMSG’ buffer
---------------------------------------------------

Neither Magit nor ‘git-commit‘ fiddle with point in the buffer used to
write commit messages, so something else must be doing it.

   You have probably globally enabled a mode which does restore point in
file-visiting buffers.  It might be a bit surprising, but when you write
a commit message, then you are actually editing a file.

   So you have to figure out which package is doing.  ‘saveplace’,
‘pointback’, and ‘session’ are likely candidates.  These snippets might
help:

     (setq session-name-disable-regexp "\\(?:\\`'\\.git/[A-Z_]+\\'\\)")

     (with-eval-after-load 'pointback
       (lambda ()
         (when (or git-commit-mode git-rebase-mode)
           (pointback-mode -1))))


File: magit.info,  Node: The mode-line information isn't always up-to-date,  Next: Emacs 245 hangs when loading Magit,  Prev: Point is wrong in the ‘COMMIT_EDITMSG’ buffer,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.9 The mode-line information isn’t always up-to-date
-------------------------------------------------------

Magit is not responsible for the version control information that is
being displayed in the mode-line and looks something like ‘Git-master’.
The built-in "Version Control" package, also known as "VC", updates that
information, and can be told to do so more often:

     (setq auto-revert-check-vc-info t)

   But doing so isn’t good for performance.  For more (overly
optimistic) information see *note (emacs)VC Mode Line::.

   If you don’t really care about seeing that information in the
mode-line, but just don’t want to see _incorrect_ information, then
consider disabling VC when using Git:

     (setq vc-handled-backends (delq 'Git vc-handled-backends))

   Or to disable it completely:

     (setq vc-handled-backends nil)


File: magit.info,  Node: Emacs 245 hangs when loading Magit,  Next: A branch and tag sharing the same name breaks SOMETHING,  Prev: The mode-line information isn't always up-to-date,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.10 Emacs 24.5 hangs when loading Magit
------------------------------------------

This is actually triggered by loading Tramp.  See
<https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=20015> for details.  You
can work around the problem by setting
‘tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options’.  Changing your DNS server (e.g.  to
Google’s ‘8.8.8.8’) may also be sufficient to work around the issue.


File: magit.info,  Node: A branch and tag sharing the same name breaks SOMETHING,  Prev: Emacs 245 hangs when loading Magit,  Up: FAQ - Issues and Errors

A.2.11 A branch and tag sharing the same name breaks SOMETHING
--------------------------------------------------------------

Or more generally, ambiguous refnames break SOMETHING.

   Magit assumes that refs are named non-ambiguously across the
"refs/heads/", "refs/tags/", and "refs/remotes/" namespaces (i.e., all
the names remain unique when those prefixes are stripped).  We consider
ambiguous refnames unsupported and recommend that you use a
non-ambiguous naming scheme.  However, if you do work with a repository
that has ambiguous refnames, please report any issues you encounter so
that we can investigate whether there is a simple fix.

B Debugging Tools
*****************

Magit and its dependencies provide a few debugging tools, and we
appreciate it very much if you use those tools before reporting an
issue.  Please include all relevant output when reporting an issue.

‘M-x magit-version’     (‘magit-version’)

     This command shows the currently used versions of Magit, Git, and
     Emacs in the echo area.  Non-interactively this just returns the
     Magit version.

‘M-x magit-emacs-Q-command’     (‘magit-emacs-Q-command’)

     This command shows a debugging shell command in the echo area and
     adds it to the kill ring.  Paste that command into a shell an run
     it.

     This shell command starts ‘emacs’ with only ‘magit’ and its
     dependencies loaded.  Neither your configuration nor other
     installed packages are loaded.  This makes it easier to determine
     whether some issue lays with Magit or something else.

‘M-x magit-debug-git-executable’     (‘magit-debug-git-executable’)

     This command displays a buffer containing information about the
     available and used ‘git’ executable(s), and can be useful when
     investigating ‘exec-path’ issues.

     Also see *note Git Executable::.

‘M-x with-editor-debug’     (‘with-editor-debug’)

     This command displays a buffer containing information about the
     available and used ‘git’ executable(s), and can be useful when
     investigating why Magit (or rather ‘with-editor’) cannot find an
     appropriate ‘emacsclient’ executable.

     Also see *note (with-editor)Debugging::.

   Please also see the *note FAQ::.
