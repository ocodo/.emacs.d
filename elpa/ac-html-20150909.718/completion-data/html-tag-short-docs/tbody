The HTML Table Body Element (<tbody>) defines one or more rows as the body of its parent <table> element when no <tr> elements are children of the parent.  In conjunction with a preceding <tfoot> and <thead> element, (<tbody>) provides additional semantic information for devices such as printers and displays. Of the parent table's child elements, (<tbody>) will represent the content, if longer than a page, that will most likely differ for each page printed. The <tfoot> and <thead> elements' content will be consistent for each page printed. For displays, (<tbody>) will enable separate scrolling from the <tfoot>, <thead> and <caption> elements of the same parent <table> element.

Content categories:
None.

Permitted content:
Zero or more <tr> elements.

Tag omission:
The <tbody> element is not a required child element for a parent <table> element  to graphically render. However, it must not be present, if its parent <table> element  has a <tr> element as a child.

Permitted parent elements:
Within the required parent <table> element, the <tbody> element can be added after a <caption>, <colgroup>, <thead> and a <tfoot> element.

DOM interface:
This element implements the HTMLTableSectionElement interface.
