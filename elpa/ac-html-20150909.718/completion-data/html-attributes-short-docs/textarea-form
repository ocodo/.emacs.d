form [HTML5]

The form element that the textarea element is associated with (its "form owner"). The value of the attribute must be an ID of a form element in the same document. If this attribute is not specified, the textarea element must be a descendant of a form element. This attribute enables you to place textarea elements anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their form elements.
