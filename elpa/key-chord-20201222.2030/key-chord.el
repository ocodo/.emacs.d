;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements support for mapping a pair of simultaneously
;; pressed keys to a command and for mapping the same key being pressed
;; twice in quick succession to a command. Such bindings are called
;; "key chords".

;;; Code:

(defgroup key-chord nil
  "Map pairs of simultaneously pressed keys to commands."
  :group 'bindings)

(defcustom key-chord-two-keys-delay 0.1
  "Max time delay between two key press to be considered a key chord."
  :type 'float)

(defcustom key-chord-one-key-delay 0.2
  "Max time delay between two press of the same key to be considered a key chord.
This should normally be a little longer than `key-chord-two-keys-delay'."
  :type 'float)

(defcustom key-chord-in-macros t
  "If nil, don't expand key chords when executing keyboard macros.

If non-nil, expand chord sequenses in macros, but only if a
similar chord was entered during the last interactive macro
recording. (This carries a bit of guesswork. We can't know for
sure when executing whether two keys were typed quickly or slowly
when recorded.)"
  :type 'boolean)

;; Internal vars
(defvar key-chord-mode nil)

;; Shortcut for key-chord-input-method: no need to test a key again if it
;; didn't matched a chord the last time. Improves feedback during autorepeat.
(defvar key-chord-last-unmatched nil)

;; Macro heuristics: Keep track of which chords was used when the last macro
;; was defined. Or rather, only the first-char of the chords. Only expand
;; matching chords during macro execution.
