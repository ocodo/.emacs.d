;; Version: 20140202.001
;; Package-Version: 20210715.1517
;; Package-Commit: 5d40ceaa2b8d41ab3634ca377ceb6a74deeb2287

;;; Documentation:
;;
;; Syntax highlighting (nouns, verb, adverbs...) in buffer.
;; This package wraps functionality of MacOSX's natural language processing tools,
;; (see details here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/reference/NSLinguisticTagger_Class/Reference/Reference.html)
;;
;; It tokenizes and highlights English text that matches specified tags.
;;
;; Dependencies:
;; - OSX
;; - syn (see instructions at https://github.com/stephencelis/syn)
;; - ido-mode
;;
;;; Usage:
;;
;; - M-x wordsmith-mode
;; - pre-defined shortcuts:
;;      C-c w n - highlight nouns in buffer
;;      C-c w v - highlight verbs in buffer
;;      C-c w w - ido menu to pick which attribute to highlight
;;      C-c w k - disable wordsmith highlighting in buffer

;;; Implementation:
;; uses overlays - potentially needs reconsidering if it affects performance too much
;;
;; TODO: include syn's 'formatter' option ('ansi', 'table', or 'json')
