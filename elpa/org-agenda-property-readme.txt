org-agenda-property is a package which displays the properties of
an org item beside (or below) the item's title in the agenda
buffer. Customize the variable `org-agenda-property-list' to add
which properties you which to show.

Instructions:

INSTALLATION

  If you installed from Melpa, you shouldn't need to do anything
  else. Just customize `org-agenda-property-list' and call your
  agenda buffer (tipically `org-agenda-list') to see the magic.

     If you installed manually, just make sure it's in your
     load-path and call
    (require 'org-agenda-property)

Variables

  All variables can be edited by running
  `org-agenda-property-customize' (seriously, chech it out, they
  are just a few :-)). The documentations are mostly self
  explanatory, I list here only the most important two.

  `org-agenda-property-list'
             This should be a list of all properties you want
             displayed in the buffer. Default is "LOCATION".

  `org-agenda-property-position'
    This is where you want the properties to be displayed
    (besides the title or below the title?).
