Start a vdiff session. If called interactively, you will be
asked to select two files. ROTATE adjusts the buffer's

variable interactively. ON-QUIT is a function to run on exiting
the vdiff session. It is called with the two vdiff buffers as
arguments.

Start a vdiff session. If called interactively, you will be
asked to select two buffers. ROTATE adjusts the buffer's
initial layout. A prefix argument can be used to set this
variable interactively. ON-QUIT is a function to run on exiting
the vdiff session. It is called with the two vdiff buffers as
arguments. The last two options, RESTORE-WINDOWS-ON-QUIT and
KILL-BUFFERS-ON-QUIT restore the previous window configuration
and kill the vdiff buffers after quitting vdiff. Note that if you
are going to kill the buffers you should probably be using a
function for ON-QUIT to do something useful with the result.
