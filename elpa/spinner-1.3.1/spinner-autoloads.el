(autoload 'spinner-create "spinner" "\
Create a spinner of the given TYPE.
The possible TYPEs are described in `spinner--type-to-frames'.

FPS, if given, is the number of desired frames per second.
Default is `spinner-frames-per-second'.

If BUFFER-LOCAL is non-nil, the spinner will be automatically
deactivated if the buffer is killed.  If BUFFER-LOCAL is a
buffer, use that instead of current buffer.

When started, in order to function properly, the spinner runs a
timer which periodically calls `force-mode-line-update' in the
curent buffer.  If BUFFER-LOCAL was set at creation time, then
`force-mode-line-update' is called in that buffer instead.  When
the spinner is stopped, the timer is deactivated.

\(fn &optional TYPE BUFFER-LOCAL FPS)" nil nil)

(autoload 'spinner-start "spinner" "\
Start a mode-line spinner of given TYPE-OR-OBJECT.
If TYPE-OR-OBJECT is an object created with `make-spinner',
simply activate it.  This method is designed for minor modes, so
they can use the spinner as part of their lighter by doing:
    '(:eval (spinner-print THE-SPINNER))
To stop this spinner, call `spinner-stop' on it.

If TYPE-OR-OBJECT is anything else, a buffer-local spinner is
created with this type, and it is displayed in the
`mode-line-process' of the buffer it was created it.  Both
TYPE-OR-OBJECT and FPS are passed to `make-spinner' (which see).
To stop this spinner, call `spinner-stop' in the same buffer.

Either way, the return value is a function which can be called
anywhere to stop this spinner.  You can also call `spinner-stop'
in the same buffer where the spinner was created.

FPS, if given, is the number of desired frames per second.
Default is `spinner-frames-per-second'.
