;; Created: 29 Jul 2014
;; Version: 0.9.10
;; Package-Requires: ((easy-kill "0.9.4"))
;; Keywords: killing, convenience

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package contains extra functions for easy-kill/easy-mark:
;;
;; * easy-mark-word
;; * easy-mark-sexp
;; * easy-mark-to-char
;; * easy-mark-up-to-char
;;
;;   These are shorthand commands for easy-marking an aimed string at
;;   point.
;;
;; * easy-kill-er-expand
;; * easy-kill-er-unexpand
;;
;;   These work like `er/expand-region' and `er/contract-region',
;;   respectively, using the functionality of the `expand-region'
;;   package.
;;
;; It also provides the following easy-kill/easy-mark targets:
;;
;; * `buffer'
;;
;;   This selects the whole buffer.
;;
;; * `buffer-before-point'
;; * `buffer-after-point'
;;
;;   These work like vi's gg/G commands, respectively.
;;
;; * `backward-line-edge'
;; * `forward-line-edge'
;;
;;   The former is like vi's ^/0 commands, and the latter is just like
;;   that in the opposite direction.
;;
;; * `string-to-char-forward'
;; * `string-to-char-backward'
;; * `string-up-to-char-forward'
;; * `string-up-to-char-backward'
;;
;;   These work like vi's f/F/t/T commands, respectively.
;;
;; Experimental ace-jump integration into easy-kill is enabled by
;; default.  `ace-jump-*-mode' can be invoked for selection when in
;; easy-kill/easy-mark mode.  You can disable this feature via a
;; customize variable `easy-kill-ace-jump-enable-p'.
;;
;; Experimental multiple-cursors-mode support for easy-kill is enabled
;; by default.  `easy-kill' and `easy-mark' will mostly work in
;; `multiple-cursors-mode'.
;;
;; Suggested settings are as follows:
;;
;;   ;; Upgrade `mark-word' and `mark-sexp' with easy-mark
;;   ;; equivalents.
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "M-@") 'easy-mark-word)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-@") 'easy-mark-sexp)
;;
;;   ;; `easy-mark-to-char' or `easy-mark-up-to-char' could be a good
;;   ;; replacement for `zap-to-char'.
;;   (global-set-key [remap zap-to-char] 'easy-mark-to-char)
;;
;;   ;; Integrate `expand-region' functionality with easy-kill
;;   (define-key easy-kill-base-map (kbd "o") 'easy-kill-er-expand)
;;   (define-key easy-kill-base-map (kbd "i") 'easy-kill-er-unexpand)
;;
;;   ;; Add the following tuples to `easy-kill-alist', preferrably by
;;   ;; using `customize-variable'.
;;   (add-to-list 'easy-kill-alist '(?^ backward-line-edge ""))
;;   (add-to-list 'easy-kill-alist '(?$ forward-line-edge ""))
;;   (add-to-list 'easy-kill-alist '(?b buffer ""))
;;   (add-to-list 'easy-kill-alist '(?< buffer-before-point ""))
;;   (add-to-list 'easy-kill-alist '(?> buffer-after-point ""))
;;   (add-to-list 'easy-kill-alist '(?f string-to-char-forward ""))
;;   (add-to-list 'easy-kill-alist '(?F string-up-to-char-forward ""))
;;   (add-to-list 'easy-kill-alist '(?t string-to-char-backward ""))
;;   (add-to-list 'easy-kill-alist '(?T string-up-to-char-backward ""))
