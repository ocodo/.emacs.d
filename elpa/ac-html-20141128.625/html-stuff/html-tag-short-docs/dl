The HTML <dl> Element (or HTML Description List Element) encloses a list of pairs of terms and descriptions. Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).

Prior to HTML5, <dl> was known as a Definition List.

Content categories:
Flow content, and if the <dl> element's children include one name-value pair, palpable content.

Permitted content:
Zero or more <dt> elements, each followed by one or more <dd> elements.

Tag omission:
None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory.

Permitted parent elements:
Any element that accepts flow content.

DOM interface:
HTMLDListElement

Tip: 
It can be handy to define a key-value seperator in the CSS3, such as: dt:after {content: ": ";}

Notes:

Do not use this element, (nor <ul> elements), to merely create indention on a page. Although it works, this is a bad practice and obscures the meaning of definition lists.

To change the indention of a description term, use the CSS margin property.
