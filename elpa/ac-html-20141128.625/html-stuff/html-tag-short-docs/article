The HTML <article> Element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable, e.g., in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content. Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the <article> element.

Usage notes:
When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.
Author information of an <article> element can be provided through the <address> element, but it doesn't apply to nested <article> elements.
The publication date and time of an <article> element can be described using the pubdate attribute of a <time> element.
