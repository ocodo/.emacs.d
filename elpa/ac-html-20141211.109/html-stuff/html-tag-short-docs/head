If the element is an <iframe>srcdoc, or if title information is available from a higher level protocol, zero or more elements of metadata content.
Otherwise, one or more elements of metadata content where exactly one is a <title> element.

Tag omission:
The start tag may be omitted if the first thing inside the head element is an element.
The end tag may be omitted if the first thing following the head element is not a space character or a comment.

Permitted parent elements:

Notes:
Most browsers automatically construct a <head> element if the tags are omitted in the markup. However some do not.
These browsers were tested as not creating a head element automatically: Android <=1.6, iPhone <=3.1.3, Nokia 90, Opera <=9.27, and Safari <=3.2.1.
