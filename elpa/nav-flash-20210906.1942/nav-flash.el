;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'nav-flash)
;;
;;     (nav-flash-show)
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Nav-flash temporarily highlights the line containing the point,
;; which is sometimes useful for orientation after a navigation
;; command.
;;
;; To use nav-flash, place the nav-flash.el library somewhere Emacs
;; can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'nav-flash)
;;
;; There is no user-level interface for this library; it is only used
;; by other Lisp libraries.  However, you might find it useful to call
;; `nav-flash-show' in your ~/.emacs file.  For example, the following
;; hook causes a flash to appear after navigating via imenu:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'imenu-after-jump-hook 'nav-flash-show nil t)
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET nav-flash RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET pulse RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     This library reuses a timer and overlay defined in compile.el,
;;     but should not affect the normal use of compile.el / `next-error'.
;;
;;     Pulse.el provides similar functionality and is included with
;;     Emacs.  This library can use pulse.el, but does not do so by
;;     default, because pulse.el uses `sit-for', breaking this type
;;     of construction:
;;
;;         (nav-flash-show)
;;         (with-temp-message "message here"
;;            (sit-for 2))
;;
;;     When using an overlay and timer for cleanup (as nav-flash does
;;     by default) the flash and message appear simultaneously.
;;
;;     Nav-flash.el is also simpler than pulse.el.
