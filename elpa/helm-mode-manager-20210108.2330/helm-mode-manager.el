;; A call to `helm-switch-major-mode' will give you a `helm' selection
;; of all available major modes.  Selecting a target will activate the
;; major mode.  The persistent action is to show help about the
;; selected major mode.
;;
;; A call to `helm-enable-minor-mode' will give you a `helm' selection
;; of all available minor modes.  Selecting a target will activate the
;; minor mode.  The persistent action is to show help about the
;; selected minor mode.

;; A call to `helm-disable-minor-mode' will give you a `helm'
;; selection of active minor modes.  Selecting a target will
;; deactivate the minor mode.  The persistent action is to show help
;; about the selected minor mode.
