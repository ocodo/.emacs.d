id

This attribute defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS).

Usage note:
This attribute's value is an opaque string: this means that web author must not use it to convey any information. Particular meaning, for example semantic meaning, must not be derived from the string.
This attribute's value must not contain white spaces. Browsers treat non-conforming IDs that contains white spaces as if the white space is part of the ID. In contrast to the class attribute, which allows space-separated values, elements can only have one single ID defined through the id attribute. Note that an element may have several IDs, but the others should be set by another means, such as via a script interfacing with the DOM interface of the element.
Using characters except ASCII letters and digits, '_', '-' and '.' may cause compatibility problems, as they weren't allowed in HTML 4. Though this restriction has been lifted in HTML 5, an ID should start with a letter for compatibility.
