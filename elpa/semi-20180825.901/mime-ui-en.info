1 What is SEMI?
***************

SEMI is a package for GNU Emacs to provide features related with MIME
user interface.

   SEMI provides two user interfaces: MIME-View and MIME-Edit.

   MIME-View is a kernel of user interface to display or operate MIME
messages, STD 11 messages or "localized RFC 822" messages.

   MIME-Edit is a user interface to compose MIME messages.

   Each MUA can use powerful MIME features to combine these features.

2 MIME message viewing
**********************

MIME-View is a MIME viewer for wide use that runs on GNU Emacs.

   MIME-View is the kernel of the user interface for browsing MIME
messages.  You can start some presentation-method which is a program for
creating some representation, or some acting-method which is a program
for processing the entity.  Then you can deal with a variety of
entities.

* mime-view-mode::              Operation in mime-preview-buffer

2.1 Basic design
================

The representation form of the internet messages in electric letters or
in net news is based on STD 11.  The STD 11 message body is a plain text
which consists of lines as its only structure, and the character code is
fixed as us-ascii.  Actually, there are "localized STD 11" messages that
use some character code in their linguistic range instead of using
us-ascii.  Even in that case, the character code in the message is
single.  Therefore, Message User Agents have considered (byte row) =
(us-ascii string), or (byte row) = (string in the character code in the
linguistic range).

   Although, the MIME message has the tree structure in entity unit.
And one message can contain multiple character codes.  The content of an
entity can be not only a letter or an image that can be displayed
simply, but also can be a voice or an animation that are played for some
time interval, a data for some specific application, a source code of
some program, or an external reference that consists of the usage of ftp
or mail service, or some URL. Therefore the simple extension of STD 11
user interface, which only consider displaying the message, cannot treat
all of the MIME functionalities.  Then it is not sufficient to decode
message along its MIME type, but it is also required to consider a
playback processing through some dialogue with the user.  The format of
MIME messages is designed to easily be passed to automatic processing.
But some contents in the MIME message should not be passed to automatic
processing for security reasons.  So it should be designed to ask user
in such cases.  After all, in order to deal with MIME message, it is
required to distinguish the representation for information exchange
which is written in STD 11 or MIME construction, and its result after
some interpretation which is a display screen or a playback process.  It
is also needed to converse with user for playback processing.

   Therefore, MIME-View uses two buffers for one document, one is the
mime-raw-buffer that stores the representation for information exchange,
and the other is the mime-preview-buffer that stores the representation
for displaying.

   MIME-View provides a mode in the mime-preview-buffer for reading MIME
message, which is called as mime-view-mode.  User can manipulate each
entity there.

2.2 Presentation of mime-preview-buffer
=======================================

mime-view-mode displays information about each entity as

     	[entity-button]
     	(header)

     	(body)
     	(separator)

You can change their design or inhibit showing some of them, according
to some condition.

   See following example

       How to compose MIME message in MIME-Edit mode.

       C-c C-x ? shows its help.

     C-c C-x C-t	insert a text message.
     C-c C-x TAB	insert a (binary) file.
     C-c C-x C-e	insert a reference to external body.
     C-c C-x C-v	insert a voice message.
     C-c C-x C-y	insert a mail or news message.
     C-c C-x RET	insert a mail message.
     C-c C-x C-s	insert a signature file at end.
     C-c C-x t	insert a new MIME tag.
     C-c C-m C-a	enclose as multipart/alternative.
     C-c C-m C-p	enclose as multipart/parallel.
     C-c C-m C-m	enclose as multipart/mixed.
     C-c C-m C-d	enclose as multipart/digest.
     C-c C-m C-s	enclose as PGP signed.
     C-c C-m C-e	enclose as PGP encrypted.
     C-c C-x C-k	insert PGP public key.
     C-c C-x p	preview editing MIME message.
     ...

     therefore, you should type C-c C-x C-i and specify the binary file
     which you want to insert.

       You should select Base64 as MIME encoding for binary file.

     [2  (image/gif)]

     [3  (text/plain)]

       Like above, you can compose the message with image.

2.2.1 entity-button
-------------------

*entity-button* is a tag on the top of the entity which shows brief
information of the part.

   Normally, it appears as

             [1.3 test (text/plain)]


   The number on the head describes the place of the entity in the
message (like the section number) and it is called as *entity-number*.

   The string in the next describes its title.  This information is
taken from

  1. Title described in Content-Description field or Subject field
  2. File name specified by filename parameter in Content-Disposition
     field
  3. File name specified by name parameter in Content-Type field
  4. File name for uuencode'ing

If none of them are specified, displays a blank.

   The 3rd item in the parenthesis describes media-type/subtype of the
entity.  If it is is not MIME entity, it displays 'nil'.

   This entity-button plays a role like icon that symbolically shows the
content of the entity.  For example, push 'v' on

             [2  (image/gif)]

shows up the image contained there.

   If the mouse operation is possible, you can display the image by
pushing 2nd button (the middle button for 3 button mouse) too.


File: mime-ui-en.info,  Node: entity-header,  Next: entity-body,  Prev: entity-button,  Up: MIME-Preview

2.2.2 entity-header
-------------------

*entity-header* is the header of the entity.  (Don't blame me as "You
say nothing more than as it is", It is no more than that.)


File: mime-ui-en.info,  Node: entity-body,  Prev: entity-header,  Up: MIME-Preview

2.2.3 entity-body
-----------------

*entity-body* is the content of the part.

   Sophistication does not seem enough here also, but it is really such
a thing.

   Though, it actually be twisted a little.

   The text entity is passed to code conversion according to its
charset, and the image entity should be converted on XEmacs.

   Details will be described later.


File: mime-ui-en.info,  Node: mime-view-mode,  Prev: MIME-Preview,  Up: MIME-View

2.3 Operation in mime-preview-buffer
====================================

mime-preview-buffer posesses following functionalities.

'<u>'
     go back to upper part (in the first part of the message, go back to
     the Summary mode (*1))

'<p>'
     go to previous part

'<M-TAB>'
     go to previous part

'<n>'
     go to next part

'<TAB>'
     go to next part

'<SPC>'
     scroll up

'<M-SPC>'
     scroll down

'<DEL>'
     scroll down

'<RET>'
     go to next line

'<M-RET>'
     go to previous line

'<v>'
     play current part (*2)

'<e>'
     extract file from current part (*2)

'<C-c C-p>'
     print current part (*2)

'<mouse-button-2>'
     start the mouse button in preview-buffer

     on content-button, play current part (*2)

     on URL-button, start WWW browser

*[Notice]*

     (*1) Do not go back to Summary mode unless appropriately configured
     for mime-view in the MUA.

     (*2) actual behavior depends on the associated method

File: mime-ui-en.info,  Node: mime-edit-mode,  Next: single-part tags,  Prev: MIME-Edit,  Up: MIME-Edit

3.1 Minor-mode to edit MIME message
===================================

*mime-edit-mode* is a minor mode to compose MIME message.  In this mode,
*tag* represents various kinds of data, so you can edit multi part
message consists of various kinds of data, such as text, image, audio,
etc.

   There are 2 kinds of tags:

   * single-part tag
   * multi-part tag

   single-part tag represents single part, this form is following:

             --[[TYPE/SUBTYPE;PARAMETERS][ENCODING]
             OPTIONAL-FIELDS]

   TYPE/SUBTYPE and PARAMETERS indicates type/subtype and parameters of
Content-Type (*note (mime-en)Content-Type::) field.  TYPE/SUBTYPE is
required, PARAMETERS is optional.

   ENCODING indicates Content-Transfer-Encoding (*note
(mime-en)Content-Transfer-Encoding::) field.  It is optional too.

   OPTIONAL-FIELDS is to represent another fields except Content-Type
field and Content-Transfer-Encoding field.

   multi-part tags represent multi part.  They consist of a pair of
*multi-part beginning tag* and *multi-part ending tag*.

   multi-part beginning tag's form is following:

             --<<TYPE>>-{

   multi-part ending tag's form is following:

             --}-<<TYPE>>

   A region from multi-part beginning tag to multi-part ending tag is
called as *enclosure*.

3.2 Operations for single-part
==============================

Operations to make single-part are following:

'<C-c C-x C-t>'
     Insert single-part tag indicates text part.

'<C-c C-x C-i>'
     Insert file as a MIME attachment.  If 'C-u' is followed by it, it
     asks media-type, subtype or encoding even if their default values
     are specified.  (cf.  *note file-type specification::)

'<C-c C-x C-e>'
     Insert external part.

'<C-c C-x C-v>'
     Record audio input until 'C-g' is pressed, and insert as a audio
     part.  (It requires /dev/audio in default.)

'<C-c C-x C-y>'
     Insert current (mail or news) message.  (It is MUA depended.)

'<C-c C-x C-m>'
     Insert mail message.  (It is MUA depended.)

'<C-c C-x C-w>, <C-c C-x C-s>'
     Insert signature.

'<C-c C-x C-k>'
     Insert PGP (*note PGP::) public key.  (It requires Mailcrypt
     package.)

'<C-c C-x t>'
     Insert any single-part tag.


File: mime-ui-en.info,  Node: enclosure tags,  Next: other MIME-Edit operations,  Prev: single-part tags,  Up: MIME-Edit

3.3 Operations for enclosure
============================

Operations to make enclosure are following:

'<C-c C-m C-a>'
     Enclose specified region as multipart/alternative.

'<C-c C-m C-p>'
     Enclose specified region as multipart/parallel.

'<C-c C-m C-m>'
     Enclose specified region as multipart/mixed.

'<C-c C-m C-d>'
     Enclose specified region as multipart/digest.

'<C-c C-m C-s>'
     Digital-sign to specified region.  (cf.  *note PGP::)

'<C-c C-m C-e>'
     Encrypt to specified region.  (cf.  *note PGP::)

'<C-c C-m C-q>'
     avoid to encode tags in specified region.  In other words, tags is
     interpreted as such string.  (In current version, it may be
     incomplete.  Maybe PGP-signature does not work for this enclosure.)


File: mime-ui-en.info,  Node: other MIME-Edit operations,  Next: file-type specification,  Prev: enclosure tags,  Up: MIME-Edit

3.4 Other operations
====================

There are another operations in mime-edit-mode.

'<C-c C-c>'
     Send current editing message.

'<C-c C-x p>'
     Preview current editing message.  (cf.  *note MIME-View::)

'<C-c C-x C-z>'
     Exit mime-edit-mode without sending.

'<C-c C-x />'
     Set current editing message to enable automatic splitting or not.
     Form of automatic split messages is message/partial.

'<C-c C-x 7>'
     Set 7bit (*note (mime-en)7bit::) to transfer level (*note transfer
     level::).

'<C-c C-x 8>'
     Set 8bit (*note (mime-en)8bit::) to transfer level (*note transfer
     level::).

'<C-c C-x v>'
     Set current editing message to digital-sign or not.  (cf.  *note
     PGP::)

'<C-c C-x h>'
     Set current editing message to encrypt or not.  (cf.  *note PGP::)

'<C-c C-x ?>'
     Display help message.


File: mime-ui-en.info,  Node: file-type specification,  Next: transfer level,  Prev: other MIME-Edit operations,  Up: MIME-Edit

3.5 How to detect tag for inserted file
=======================================

When 'C-c C-x C-i' ('mime-edit-insert-file') is pressed, tag parameters
for inserted file, such as media-type or encoding, are detected by
variable 'mime-file-types'.

   When 'C-u' is followed by it or parameter is not found from the
variable, it asks from user.  (When 'C-u' is followed by it, detected
value is used as default value)

   If you want to change default value for file names, please change
variable 'mime-file-types'.

 -- Variable: mime-file-types

     Specification of default value of tag for file name of inserted
     file.

     It is a list of following list:

          	(FILE_PAT TYPE SUBTYPE PARAMS ENCODING
          	 DISPOSITION_TYPE DISPOSITION_PARAMS)

     Each element of the list is following:

     'FILE_PAT'
          regular expression of file name

     'TYPE'
          primary-type of media-type

     'SUBTYPE'
          subtype of media-type

     'PARAMS'
          parameters of Content-Type field

     'ENCODING'
          Content-Transfer-Encoding

     'DISPOSITION_TYPE'
          disposition-type

     'DISPOSITION_PARAMS'
          parameters of Content-Disposition field

     Example: Specify application/rtf as default media type for '*.rtf'

          (eval-after-load
              "mime-edit"
            '(set-alist 'mime-file-types
          	      "\\.rtf$"
          	      '("application" "rtf" nil nil
          		"attachment" (("filename" . file)))
          	      ))


File: mime-ui-en.info,  Node: transfer level,  Next: message/partial sending,  Prev: file-type specification,  Up: MIME-Edit

3.6 transfer level
==================

Each content inserted in a message is represented by 7bit (*note
(mime-en)7bit::), 8bit (*note (mime-en)8bit::) or binary (*note
(mime-en)binary::).

   If a message is translated by 7bit-through MTA (*note
(mime-en)MTA::), there is no need to encode 7bit data, but 8bit and
binary data must be encoded to 7bit data.

   Similarly, if a message is translated by 8bit-through MTA, there is
no need to encode 7bit or 8bit data, but binary data must be encoded to
7bit or 8bit data.

*[Memo]*
     EBCDIC MTA breaks 7bit data, so in this case, 7bit data must be
     encoded by base64.  But I don't know EBCDIC. (^_^;

     Similarly, I wish ASCII-printable only MTA and code-conversion MTA
     disappeared.  (^_^;

     Maybe there are binary-through MTA, but I think it is not major.

   *transfer level* represents how range data are available.  mime-edit
has a variable 'mime-transfer-level' to represent transfer level.

 -- Variable: mime-transfer-level

     transfer level.

     If transfer level of a data is over it, a data is encoded to 7bit.

     Currently, 7 or 8 is available.  Default value is 7.

     In extension plan, EBCDIC will be 5, ASCII printable only will be
     6, binary will be 9.  But it will not be implemented.

*[Memo]*
     transfer level is only for body, not for message header (*note
     entity-header::).  MIME extends RFC 822 (*note (mime-en)RFC 822::)
     to use 8bit data in body, but it requires to use us-ascii (*note
     (mime-en)us-ascii::) in header.

3.7 Splitting
=============

 -- Variable: mime-edit-split-message

     Split large message if it is non-nil.

 -- Variable: mime-edit-message-default-max-lines

     Default maximum lines of a message.

 -- Variable: mime-edit-message-max-lines-alist

     Alist of major-mode vs maximum lines of a message.

     If it is not specified for a major-mode,
     'mime-edit-message-default-max-lines' is used.

 -- Variable: mime-edit-split-blind-field-regexp

     Regular expression to match field-name to be ignored when split
     sending.
