When the value of the method attribute is post, enctype is the MIME type of content that is used to submit the form to the server. Possible values are:
  application/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value if the attribute is not specified.
  multipart/form-data: The value used for an <input> element with the type attribute set to "file".
  text/plain (HTML5)
This value can be overridden by a formenctype attribute on a <button> or <input> element.
