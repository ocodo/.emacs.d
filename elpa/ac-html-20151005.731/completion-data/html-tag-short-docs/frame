Deprecated.

<frame> is an HTML element which defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a <frameset>.

Using the <frame> element is not encouraged because of certain disadvantages such as performance problems and lack of accessibility for users with screen readers. Instead of the <frame> element, <iframe> may be preferred.
