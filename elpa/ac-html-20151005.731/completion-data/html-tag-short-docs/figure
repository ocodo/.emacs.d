The HTML <figure> Element represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption (<figcaption>), and is typically referenced as a single unit. While it is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow. Usually this is an image, an illustration, a diagram, a code snippet, or a schema that is referenced in the main text, but that can be moved to another page or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.

Usage notes:
Being a sectioning root, the outline of the content of the <figure> element is excluded from the main outline of the document.
A caption can be associated with the <figure> element by inserting a <figcaption> inside it (as the first or the last child).
