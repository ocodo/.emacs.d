Jump to a buffer in the current project.

Search the current project with grep.

If inside a git project and `projectile-use-git-grep' is non-nil,
use git grep. Otherwise use grep recursively.

OPTIONS-OR-CMD, if non-nil, is a string containing either
additional options to be passed to grep, or an alternative git
grep command. It is read from the minibuffer if the function is
called with a `\\[universal-argument]' prefix argument.

\(fn &optional OPTIONS-OR-CMD)" t nil)

CMD, if non-nil, is a string containing an alternative git grep

Capture into the current project.

This command is a replacement for `org-capture' (or
`counsel-org-capture') offering project-specific capture
templates, in addition to the regular templates available from
`org-capture'. These project templates, which are \"expanded\"
relatively to the current project, are determined by the
variables `counsel-projectile-org-capture-templates' and
`counsel-projectile-org-capture-templates-contexts'. See the
former variable in particular for details.

Optional argument FROM-BUFFER specifies the buffer from which to
capture.

Open project agenda.

This command simply calls `org-agenda' after filtering out all
agenda files that do not belong to the current project.

Optional arguments ARG, KEYS, and RESTRICTION are as in
`org-agenda'.

Non-nil if Counsel-Projectile mode is enabled.
See the `counsel-projectile-mode' command

Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `counsel-projectile-mode'.")

Toggle Counsel-Projectile mode on or off.

With a prefix argument ARG, enable the mode if ARG is positive,
and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode
if ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if ARG is `toggle'.

Counsel-Projectile mode turns on Projectile mode, thus enabling
all projectile key bindings, and adds the counsel-projectile key
bindings on top of them.

The counsel-projectile key bindings either remap existing
projectile commands to their counsel-projectile replacements or
bind keys to counsel-projectile commands that have no projectile
counterparts.
