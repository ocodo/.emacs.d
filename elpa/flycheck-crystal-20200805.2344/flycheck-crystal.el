;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides error-checking support for the Crystal language to the
;; Flycheck package.  To use it, have Flycheck installed, then add the following
;; to your init file:
;;
;;    (require 'flycheck-crystal)
;;    (add-hook 'crystal-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)

;;; Code:

(require 'flycheck)
(require 'json)

(defgroup flycheck-crystal nil
  "Crystal mode's flycheck checker."

(defcustom flycheck-crystal-show-instantiating nil
  "Whether \"instantiated by\" messages should be shown.
These messages typically show the (static) backtrace of an error and are of
little interest."

  "Come up with a suitable default directory to run CHECKER in.
This will either be the directory that contains `shard.yml' or,
if no such file is found in the directory hierarchy, the directory
of the current file."
