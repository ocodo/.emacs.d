(autoload 'org-hugo-slug "ox-hugo" "\
Convert string STR to a `slug' and return that string.

A `slug' is the part of a URL which identifies a particular page
on a website in an easy to read form.

Example: If STR is \"My First Post\", it will be converted to a
slug \"my-first-post\", which can become part of an easy to read
URL like \"https://example.com/posts/my-first-post/\".

In general, STR is a string.  But it can also be a string with
Markdown markup as that string passed to this function is often
the sub-headings of a post (which can contain bold, italics,
link, etc markup).

The `slug' generated from that STR follows these rules:

- Contain only lower case alphabet, number and hyphen characters
  ([[:alnum:]-]).
- Not have *any* HTML tag like \"<code>..</code>\",
  \"<span class=..>..</span>\", etc.
- Not contain any URLs (if STR happens to be a Markdown link).
- Replace \".\" in STR with \"dot\", \"&\" with \"and\",
  \"+\" with \"plus\".
- Replace parentheses with double-hyphens.  So \"foo (bar) baz\"
  becomes \"foo--bar--baz\".
- Replace non [[:alnum:]-] chars with spaces, and then one or
  more consecutive spaces with a single hyphen.
- At most two consecutive hyphens are allowed.
- No hyphens allowed at the leading or trailing end of the slug.
