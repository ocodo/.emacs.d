;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Additional functionality that makes flymake error messages appear
;; in the minibuffer when point is on a line containing a flymake
;; error. This saves having to mouse over the error, which is a
;; keyboard user's annoyance.
;;
;; -------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; This flymake-cursor module displays the flymake error in the
;; minibuffer, after a short delay.  It is based on code I found roaming
;; around on the net, unsigned and unattributed. I suppose it's public
;; domain, because, while there is a "License" listed in it, there
;; is no license holder, no one to own the license.
;;
;; This version is modified slightly from that code. The post-command fn
;; defined in this code does not display the message directly. Instead
;; it sets a timer, and when the timer fires, the timer event function
;; displays the message.
;;
;; The reason to do this: the error message is displayed only if the
;; user doesn't do anything, for about one second. This way, if the user
;; scrolls through a buffer and there are myriad errors, the minibuffer
;; is not constantly being updated.
;;
;; If the user moves away from the line with the flymake error message
;; before the timer expires, then no error is displayed in the minibuffer.
;;
;; I've also updated the names of the defuns. They all start with flyc now.
;;
;;; Usage:
;; (require 'flymake-cursor)
;; You can, of course, put that in an eval-after-load clause.
