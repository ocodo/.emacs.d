  "Return a new streaming S-expression parser.

This parser is designed to incrementally read an S-expression
whose structure is known to the caller.  Like a typical
S-expression parsing interface, it provides a function to read a
complete S-expression from the input.  However, it extends this
with an additional function that requires the next value in the
input to be a list and descends into it, allowing its elements to
be read one at a time or further descended into.  Both functions
can return 'retry to indicate that not enough input is available.

The parser always consumes input from point in the current
buffer.  Hence, the caller is allowed to delete any data before
point and may resynchronize after an error by moving point."
