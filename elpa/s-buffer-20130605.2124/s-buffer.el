;;; Commentary:

;; The awesome s library for EmacsLisp has great extensions for doing
;; string operations. Some of those operations would be useful on
;; buffers. So this is those operations fitted for buffers.

;;; Code:

(require 's)

(defun s-buffer-format (buffer replacer &optional data)
  (let ((str (with-current-buffer buffer (buffer-string))))
    (s-format str replacer data)))

(defmacro s-buffer-lex-format (buffer)
  "Use scope to resolve the variables in BUFFER.

The buffer form of `s-lex-format'."
  `(s-lex-format (with-current-buffer (eval ,buffer)
                   (buffer-string))))

(provide 's-buffer)
