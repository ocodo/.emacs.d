;;; Commentary:

;; This is a minor mode to insert semicolon smartly, like Eclipse does.
;;
;; When `smart-semicolon-mode' is enabled, typing ";" inserts
;; semicolon at the end of line if there is no semicolon there.
;;
;; If there is semicolon at the end of line, typing ";" inserts
;; semicolon at the point.
;;
;; After smart semicolon insert, backspace command reverts the behavior
;; as if ";" is inserted normally.
;;
;; To enable it, add `smart-semicolon-mode' to some major mode hook.
;;
;;     (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook #'smart-semicolon-mode)
