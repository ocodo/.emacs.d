Works with either "jslint" from jslint.com, or "jsl" from
javascriptlint.com. The default is "jsl", if that executable is
found at load-time. Otherwise, "jslint" is the default. If you want
to use the non-default checker, you can customize the values of
`flymake-jslint-command' and `flymake-jslint-args' accordingly.

Usage:
  (require 'flymake-jslint)
  (add-hook 'js-mode-hook 'flymake-jslint-load)
