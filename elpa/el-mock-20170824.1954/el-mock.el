;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs Lisp Mock is a library for mocking and stubbing using
;; readable syntax. Most commonly Emacs Lisp Mock is used in
;; conjunction with Emacs Lisp Expectations, but it can be used in
;; other contexts.

;;; Commands:

;; Below are complete command list:

;; Below are customizable option list:

;; Emacs Lisp Mock provides two scope interface of mock and stub:
;; `with-mock' and `mocklet'. `with-mock' only defines a
;; scope. `mocklet' is more sophisticated interface than `with-mock':
;; `mocklet' defines local mock and stub like `let', `flet', and
;; `macrolet'.

;; Within `with-mock' body (or argument function specified in
;; `mock-protect'), you can create a mock and a stub. To create a
;; stub, use `stub' macro. To create a mock, use `mock' macro.
  
;; For further information: see docstrings.

Mocks are temporary functions which accept specified arguments and return constant value.
If mocked functions are not called or called by different arguments, an `mock-error' occurs.
Mocks are removed outside `with-mock' and `mocklet'.

Synopsis:
* (mock (FUNCTION ARGS...))
  Create a FUNCTION mock which returns nil.
* (mock (FUNCTION ARGS...) => RETURN-VALUE)
  Create a FUNCTION mock which returns RETURN-VALUE.
* (mock (FUNCTION ARGS...) :times N)
  FUNCTION must be called N times.

  Create a FUNCTION mock which returns RETURN-VALUE.

Wildcard:
The `*' is a special symbol: it accepts any value for that argument position.

ARGS that are not `*' are evaluated when the mock is verified,
i.e. upon leaving the enclosing `with-mock' form.  ARGS are
evaluated using dynamic scoping.  The RETURN-VALUE is evaluated
when executing the mocked function.

Example:
  (with-mock
