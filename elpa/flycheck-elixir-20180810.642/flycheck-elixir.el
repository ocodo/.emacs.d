;;; flycheck-elixir.el --- Support Elixir in flycheck

;; Copyright (C) 2016 Lorenzo Bolla <lbolla@gmail.com>
;;
;; Author: Lorenzo Bolla <lbolla@gmail.com>
;; Created: 26 March 2016
;; Version: 1.0
;; Package-Version: 20180810.642
;; Package-Requires: ((flycheck "0.25"))

;;; Commentary:

;; This package adds support for elixir to flycheck.  It requires
;; elixir>=1.2.3.
;; Warning: running the checker will effectively execute the buffer,
;; therefore it may be unsafe to run.  See
;; https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/630

;; To use it, add to your init.el:

;; (require 'flycheck-elixir)
;; (add-hook 'elixir-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)
