;;; Commentary:

;; A `lentic-chunk-configuration' environment where one buffer is latex
;; and the other is some programming language, with code chunks marked up with
;; a =\begin{code}\end{code}= environment.

;; The code environment is not normally defined and has been picked for this
;; reason. It avoids defining multiple init functions for different macros;
;; instead the code chunks can be interpreted using what ever environment the
;; author wants, by defining the code environment first.

;;; Code:

;; #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'lentic-chunk)
