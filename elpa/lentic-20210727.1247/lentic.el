;;; Commentary:

;; `lentic' enables /lenticular text/: simultaneous editing and viewing of the
;; same (or closely related) text in two or more buffers, potentially in
;; different modes. Lenticular text is named after lenticular printing, which
;; produce images which change depending on the angle at which they are
;; viewed.

;; Sometimes, it would be nice to edit a file in two ways at once. For
;; instance, you might have a source file in a computational language with
;; richly marked documentation. As Emacs is a modal editor, it would be nice
;; to edit this file both in a mode for the computational language and for the
;; marked up documentation.

;; One solution to this is to use a single-mode which supports both types of
;; editing. The problem with this is that it is fundamentally difficult to
;; support two types of editing at the same time; more over, you need a new
;; mode for each combination. Another solution is to use one of the
;; multiple-mode tools which are available. The problem with this is that they
;; generally need some support from the modes in question. And, again, the
;; difficulty is supporting both forms of editing in the same environment. A
;; final problem is that it is not just the editing environment that needs to
;; be adapted; the programmatic environment needs to be untroubled by the
;; documentation, and the documentation environment untroubled by the program
;; code.

;; Lenticular text provides an alternative solution. Two lentic buffers, by
;; default, the share content but are otherwise independent. Therefore,
;; you can have two buffers open, each showing the content in different modes;
;; to switch modes, you simply switch buffers. The content, location of point,
;; and view are shared.

;; Moreover, lentic buffers can also perform a bi-directional transformation
;; between the two. If this is done, then the two can have different but
;; related text. This also solves the problem of integration with a
;; tool-chain; each lentic buffer can be associated with a different file and
;; a different syntax. For example, this file is, itself, lenticular text. It
;; can be viewed either as Emacs-Lisp or in Org-Mode. In Emacs-Lisp mode, this
;; text is commented out, in org-mode it is not.

;; In fact, although the default behaviour of lentic appears to keep the same
;; text in each buffer, even it uses this bi-directional transformation
;; capability; while the text is shared, the text properties are not. This is
;; a behaviour which differs between lentic buffers and indirect buffers. The
;; lentic buffers can therefore be in different modes without fighting each
;; other to set the text properties.

;; It is possible to configure the transformation for any two buffers in a
;; extensible way. Mostly I have concentrated on mode-specific operation,
;; but, for instance, I have also used this ability on a per-project basis
;; controlling, for instance, the location of the lentic-file.

;;; Usage:

;; lentic can be installed through MELPA/Marmalade then add

;; (global-lentic-mode)

;; to your .emacs.

;; The main user entry points are accessible through the lentic edit menu, or
;; through `global-lentic-mode' which adds keybindings to create and manipulate
;; new lentic buffers. See `lentic-mode' commentary for more information.

;; By default, the lentic buffer created contains exactly the same contents as
;; the original buffer, but is otherwise separate; it can have a different major
;; modes, different syntax highlighting, invisible regions and even different
;; narrowing. Saving one buffer will save the other; killing the lentic buffer
;; does not affect the original, but killing the original also kills the lentic.

;; While this is somewhat useful, more generally a buffer will be configured to
;; produce a particular transformation. This can control many features of the
;; lentic, including the file name, major mode and an arbitrary transformation
;; between the two. Configuration is considered next.

;;; Configuration:

;; lentic buffers are configurable in a large number of ways. It is possible
;; to control the nature of the transformation, the default buffer name that a
;; lentic buffer takes, and the file location (or not) of the lentic buffer.
;; Lentic now supports any number of lentic buffers, in relatively arbitrary
;; geometries, although this requires additional support from the
;; configuration objects.

;; Configuration of a buffer happens in one of two places. First,
;; `lentic-init' is run when a lentic buffer is first created. This function
;; should return the configuration object, and is mostly designed for use as a
;; file-local or dir-local variable. This object is stored in the `lentic-config'
;; and all subsequent operation happens through this.

;; There are now a number of different configurations, which can be used for
;; general-purposes use as well as an extension points for subclass
;; configurations. The two most general configurations are:

;;  - default: this copies all text exactly, but does not transfer
;;    text-properties (which is the behaviour of indirect buffers). It is
;;    possible to configure the default file or mode on a per-object basis.
;;  - chunk: this is designed for programmatic syntaxes where chunks of code are
;;    demarcated by start and end tags, and everything else is commented by
;;    line-start comments. Comments are added or removed between the two buffers.

;; The second of these is extended in lentic-org.el to provide the
;; configuration for this file: there is a normal emacs-lisp file in one buffer
;; and an org-mode version in another. Other programmatic and documentation modes
;; are supported in other files.

;;; Status:

;; This is a beta release, but is now nearly feature complete. The core lentic
;; libraries should hopefully be fairly stable now, however, there is the
;; possibility that it will behave badly and may result in data loss. Please
;; use with care on files with backups.

;; Previous releases of this package were called "linked-buffer". I changed
;; this because I wanted a name for the general idea of text with two
;; visualisations; "linked text" doesn't work because it is sounds like
;; hyperlinked text.

;; Although it is still too early to guarantee, I hope that the current
;; configuration scheme will remain fixed, and subclass extensions should
;; require little change for the future.

;; ** State

;; This section defines all of the variables that the basic state for lentic
;; is stored in. We deliberately have as few of these as possible, as this
;; makes re-initializing the state during development as straight-forward as
;; possible.

;; We start with `lentic-init' which provides the ability to define some default
;; configuration for a buffer. These are just functions which return
;; `lentic-configuration' objects. This is a slight step of indirection but is
;; essentially there to allow the use of file- or dir-local variables to define
;; the default behaviour for a given buffer. All the values have to be defined by
;; the user as safe, so we do not want too many different values.

;; #+begin_src emacs-lisp

This should be one or a list of functions that each return a
`lentic-configuration' object.")

;; #+end_src

;; The `lentic-config' variable stores all of the configuration objects for each
;; lentic-buffer of this-buffer. Each lentic-buffer should have one configuration
;; object and is this configuration object that controls the behaviour and
;; updating of that lentic. As lentics are bi-directional, the `lentic-config'
;; variable should be -- for each lentic-configuration object in this-buffer
;; pointing to that-buffer there should be one in that-buffer pointing to
;; this-buffer. This variable has to `permanent-local' otherwise a new mode (or
;; typing `normal-mode') would break everything.

;; ** Base Configuration

;; This section defines the base class and generic methods for all

;; However, there are a few properties which store state about the last
;; before-change event that occured which are used to percolate the changes
;; correctly. This is a handy place to store these, but are not really

;; live. This happens for instance if a lentic buffer is deleted -- the buffer

;; the `after-change-function' defines a "dirty region" which we need to update
;; by copying from the parent and then doing what ever transformation needs to

;; `lentic-clone' can actually replace much more than this, and often needs to do

;; So, when a lentic-buffer updates it needs to update it's own dirty region but
;; also return the dirty region that it has created, so that any lentic buffers
;; that it in turn has that are still to be updated can be so. Or, if it doesn't,
;; we just assume the whole buffer is dirty which is safe but inefficient.
