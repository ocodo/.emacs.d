;;; Commentary:

;; A `lentic-chunk-configuration' environment where one buffer is markdown
;; and the other is some programming language. Only fenced code blocks
;; are supported as indentation based blocks is challenging.

;;; Code:
(require 'lentic-chunk)

(defun lentic-markdown-clojure-oset (conf)
  (lentic-m-oset
   conf
   :this-buffer (current-buffer)
   :comment ";; "
   :comment-start "```$"
   :comment-stop "```{.*}$"))

(defun lentic-clojure-to-markdown-new ()
  (lentic-markdown-clojure-oset
   (lentic-commented-chunk-configuration
    "lb-commented clojure latex"
    :lentic-file
    (concat
     (file-name-sans-extension
      (buffer-file-name)) ".md"))))

;;;###autoload
(defun lentic-clojure-markdown-init ()
  (lentic-clojure-to-markdown-new))

(add-to-list 'lentic-init-functions
             'lentic-clojure-markdown-init)
