;;; dart-mode.el --- Major mode for editing Dart files -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; URL: https://github.com/bradyt/dart-mode
;; Package-Version: 20210830.0
;; Package-Commit: 3bac14200f9f8f8fcebc383087572da5c3823c34
;; Version: 1.0.7
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.3"))
;; Keywords: languages

;; The author is Brady Trainor, but removed from keywords in attempt
;; to avoid some class of robots.

;; Honorable mention to previous author, maintainer and
;; contributors. Please see git history for significant
;; contributions. They are mostly gone from the current repo, replaced
;; or split out to dart-server repo. Most of the Github stars are from
;; previous management. The mistakes and regressions in the rewrite
;; below are my own. The previous implementation was done with cc-mode
;; framework. Let me know if you think it should be added back as an
;; option.

;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode for editing Dart files.

;; Provides basic syntax highlighting and indentation.
