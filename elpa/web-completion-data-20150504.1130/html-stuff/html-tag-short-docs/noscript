The HTML <noscript> Element defines a section of html to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.

Content categories:
Metadata content, flow content, phrasing content.

Permitted content:
When scripting is disabled and when it is a descendant of the <head> element: in any order, zero or more <link> elements, zero or more <style> elements, and zero or more <meta> elements.
When scripting is disabled and when it isn't a descendant of the <head> element: any transparent content, but no <noscript> element must be among its descendants.
Otherwise: flow content or phrasing content.

Tag omission:
None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory.

Permitted parent elements:
Any element that accepts phrasing content, if there are no ancestor <noscript> element, or in a <head> element (but only for an HTML document), here again if there are no ancestor <noscript> element.
