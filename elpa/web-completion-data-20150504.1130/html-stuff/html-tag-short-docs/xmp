!OBSOLETE!
The HTML Example Element (<xmp>) renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide enough to allow 80 characters per line.

Note: 
Do not use this element.
It has been deprecated since HTML3.2 and was not implemented in a consistent way. It was completely removed from the language in HTML5.
Use the <pre> element or, if semantically adequate, the <code> element instead. Note that you will need to escape the '<' character as '&lt;' to make sure it is not interpreted as markup.
A monospaced font can also be obtained on any element, by applying an adequate CSS style using monospace as the generic-font value for the font-family property.
